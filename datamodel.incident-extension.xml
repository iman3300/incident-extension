					Prevent automatically computed impacted items from being linked to this class.
					This does not modify the tab Impact Analysis, which will work exactly like before.
					
					There used to be modifications to the OnInsert() and OnUpdate() methods of a Change.
					However, there were also some other minor changes by Combodo in between iTop versions. 
					Nowadays it seems easier to give this class its own harmless UpdateImpactedItems() method.
					UpdateImpactedItems() is inherited from the Ticket class.
